## 8051 Visitor Registration and Counting System with Departmental Tracking

This project implements a visitor registration and counting system using an 8051 microcontroller. The system is designed to simulate in Proteus and provides functionalities for visitor registration, counting, and departmental tracking. The project is developed using Keil51 compiler.

## Features

- **Visitor Registration:** Users can register their presence upon entry, selecting their respective department.
  
- **Visitor Counting:** Real-time tracking of total visitors and department-wise counts.
  
- **Exit Detection:** Accurate tracking of visitor departures to update the count accordingly.
  
- **LCD Display:** Provides a user-friendly interface to display visitor counts and department-wise data.

## Additional Specific Tasks

- **Record of Indexed Departments:** Efficient tracking of visitors by department.
  
- **Visiting Activities Record:** External memory records visiting activities including date/time, activity type, department, and total occupants per department.
  
- **Highly Occupied Departments List:** Hourly list of highly occupied departments within a 24-hour cycle.

## Getting Started

1. **Software Requirements:**
   - Proteus (for simulation)
   - Keil51 compiler (for firmware development)

2. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/8051-Visitor-Registration.git
   ```

3. **Open in Keil51:**
   Open the project in Keil51 and build the firmware.

4. **Simulate in Proteus:**
   Open the Proteus simulation file and run the simulation.

5. **Explore the Code:**
   - `main.c`: Contains the main firmware code.
   - `lcd.h`: Header file for LCD functions.
   - `lcd.c`: Source file for LCD functions.

## Usage

1. Simulate the project in Proteus.
2. Follow on-screen instructions to register visitor entry and exit.
3. View visitor counts and department-wise data on the LCD display.
